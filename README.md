# HR Attrition Analysis Dashboard

A data analytics project focused on identifying key factors contributing to employee attrition using data cleaning, EDA, and interactive visualizations.

# Project Overview

Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, directly impacting productivity, hiring costs, and team morale.
This project analyzes HR data to uncover why employees leave, what factors influence retention, and how companies can take data-driven decisions to reduce attrition.

The project includes:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Insights generation

Interactive dashboard creation

Business recommendations

# Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key steps performed:

Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Standardized numerical features

Created new derived variables (e.g., Attrition Risk Groups)

# Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA was conducted to analyze patterns across:

Age and Attrition

Salary and Job Satisfaction

Overtime Impact

Job Role vs Attrition Rate

Years at Company vs Attrition risk

Work-Life Balance

Education, Marital Status trends

Tools used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

# Dashboard Outcomes

The dashboard highlights:

Overall Attrition Rate

Factors with highest impact

High-risk departments

Employee satisfaction levels

Insights for HR decision-making

# Tools used:

Power BI (main dashboard)

Excel (initial profiling)

SQL/Python (data transformation)

# Key Insights

✔ Employees doing overtime show significantly higher attrition
✔ Younger employees (25–35) have the highest exit rate
✔ Low job satisfaction strongly correlates with attrition
✔ Sales & R&D departments show higher turnover
✔ Higher monthly income reduces attrition probability

# Business Recommendations

Implement flexible working hours

Increase engagement and satisfaction programs

Targeted retention strategies for high-risk roles

Improve career development opportunities

Monitor workload and overtime distribution

# Tools & Technologies

Python – Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Power BI – Dashboard and data visualization

SQL – Data querying
